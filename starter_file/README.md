# Predicting Diabetes

This is the Capstone project for Machine Learning Engineer for Azure Nanodegree by Udacity. In this project, I will use AutoML and HyperDrive to train models to predict whether a person has diabetes.


## Project Set Up and Installation
This dataset can be found at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) and you must have an account with them in order to download the data.


## Dataset

### Overview
In this project, I will be analyzing which factors are most important in predicting diabetes. This dataset can be found at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/pima-indians-diabetes-database) and is originally from the National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases. This is a subset of a larger database and only contains patients that are females at least 21 years old of Pima Indian heritage.

The dataset contains several medical predictor variables such as BMI, glucose levels, and age, and the outcome variable of whether the patient has diabetes or not.

### Task
Diabetes has affected both sides of my family for many generations and I want to learn the factors that contribute to it besides from being genetically predisposed. This project will allow me to determine which factors are most important and potentially help me avoid the same diagnosis.

### Access
After downloading from Kaggle, I load the data into my Azure ML Studio and read the data from there.



## Automated ML
*TODO*: Give an overview of the `automl` settings and configuration you used for this experiment

### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your automated ML model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.



## Hyperparameter Tuning
*TODO*: What kind of model did you choose for this experiment and why? Give an overview of the types of parameters and their ranges used for the hyperparameter search


### Results
*TODO*: What are the results you got with your model? What were the parameters of the model? How could you have improved it?

*TODO* Remeber to provide screenshots of the `RunDetails` widget as well as a screenshot of the best model trained with it's parameters.



## Model Deployment
*TODO*: Give an overview of the deployed model and instructions on how to query the endpoint with a sample input.



## Screen Recording
*TODO* Provide a link to a screen recording of the project in action. Remember that the screencast should demonstrate:
- A working model
- Demo of the deployed  model
- Demo of a sample request sent to the endpoint and its response



## Standout Suggestions
*TODO (Optional):* This is where you can provide information about any standout suggestions that you have attempted.
